qetesh is the server program for the Qetesh web framework. It runs as a standalone, lightweight HTTP server. It automatically loads the appropriate library file(s) for a given application, along with HTML content (views). It provides runtime access to the Qetesh Framework, which in turn provides a high level interface for developing fast, robust web applications with rapid development and deployment.

Qetesh is written entirely in Vala and released under the GPL3.

Qetesh was created by Dan Ladds <dan@el-topo.co.uk>
