The example project is developed with the following purposes in mind:

1. To demonstrate the features of Qetesh in an appealing manner.
2. To function as a how-to for all features through in-code documentation.
3. To function as an implementation to develop Qetesh features with, and test the full pipeline.

INSTALL:

Install as usual, then point your web server to the files in /usr/local/share/qetesh-example
You can copy the files to another location if you want to edit the project.
The Qetesh module should install automatically. The settings may need to be edited for the database and hostname.
The database dump can be found in ./db
